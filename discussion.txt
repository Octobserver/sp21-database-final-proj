# Modications - briey summarize any changes you made to your project after selecting a domain and list of questions in Phase A (did you change subject domains due to lack of data? did you replace questions from your original list of 15, or expand the list? did you pull in an additional data source to enrich the project?)

After selecting domand and list of questions, we modify a few questions after realzing some of it cannot be answered with selected dataset. For instance, initially we want to answer how does total sales of tissue, toilet paper and alcohol change over time in US, but later realize that no exisiting dataset have specific information of sales of each goods in US. Therefore we change the question to total average spending change in US. 

We also add a new dataset of US State Name and State Fips code from US Census Bureau. This is becuase we realize user don't really know which state name does each state fip code represent, so to improve user's experience, we chagne the query and replace statefips code by state name. 


# Process - an (updated, if necessary) version of process.txt from Phase C, explaining your data sources and how you cleaned and prepared the data for insertion into your database

For the Hopital Table:

# Successes - describe 2-3 technical portions of your project about which you'd like to brag a little (for example, what was a particularly challenging aspect of writing your database that you'd like to highlight so the course staff don't overlook its complexity?)
1. We are able to answer questions like "What is the proportion of people who hold negative attitude toward covid in each country?" by creating VIEW TotalTweetsByCountry and VIEW NegTweetsByCountry, later use an sql query to calculate the portion. 
2. We are able to create visulization of total covid cases in each continent 


# Known Issues - a description of places in the implementation of your project, if any, where you did not fully succeed (are there bugs? are there unimplemented features?) 
1. If users put sql code inside as input, there hasn't been any prevention method implemented 
2. Insert tuples foreign key constraints is rejected all the time

# Extensions - beyond fixing any known issues mentioned above, what additional functionality do you most wish you had time to add to your project? Describe at least two new features.
1. implement prevention to malicious code inputs 
2. implement the insert tuples features
